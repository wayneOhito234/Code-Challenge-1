# Code Challenge 1 – JavaScript Utilities

## Description
This project is a collection of beginner-level JavaScript utilities developed as part of a coding challenge. The goal is to build interactive command-line or browser-based applications using basic JavaScript concepts such as functions, conditionals, user input, and arithmetic operations.

### Included Tools:
- **Chai Bora Calculator** – Calculates ingredients needed to prepare a number of cups of Chai Bora.
- **Scuber Fare Calculator** – Determines ride fare based on distance traveled.
- **Fee Calculator** – Calculates fee balances based on total fees and amount paid.
